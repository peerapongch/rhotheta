# rhotheta
extension of boosted regression for rho and theta estimation

This is the code base for the scripts used in my third year project at University of Warwick. The corresponding report can be found at https://www.overleaf.com/read/srhvhtfjxvbh.

To use these files, simulate the required data using Hudson's simulation software ms (documentation found at https://snoweye.github.io/phyclust/document/msdoc.pdf) and put the data into the appropriate directotry. ms is included in the folder msdir. 
For model comparison, refer to the relevant scripts. Note that GENETREE is also included for convenience. 

Inside the folder src, the scripts are prefixed as followed:
 - one: means that the scripts are used in Phase 1 of the project as descripted in the report
 - two: for Phase 2 
 - uf: utility functions which are called at various points of the project 
 - us: utility scripts for execution of routine operations with default parameters
